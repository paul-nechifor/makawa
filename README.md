Makawa
======

This is a Java implementation of the **Macaua** card game. I did this back in
2009 when I first started using Java so excuse the bad code (things like using
the Vector class and very long lines).

The game is more advanced than others I've played. The rules of Macaua are very
disputed and I wanted to build a game (with the AI) that can play by any of the
rules you provide with an unlimited number of players and decks. This almost
does that, but the configuration is done in the code.

My intention was to build a GUI client for it, but that never happened and
nobody is going to install Java to play a game. I still think that sometime in
the future I'll do this in HTML5.

The code is both written and commented in Romanian. Here's how it looks when you
open it.
